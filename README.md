# PEDAL GRAPHIC MATERIALS AND PROCEDURE
This is a walkthrough on how to prepare an artwork for pedal enclosure UV printing in Adobe Illustrator. Make sure to **create everything in CMYK**.

## Preparing the artwork

<br>

### 1. Make sure to layout everything on the correct knob/switch layout and Ai artboard.
*Use the hardware vector packs to check for size tolerances and overall look. All important texts should be visible and no hardware should overlap/touch each other.*

<br>

### 2. Once everything looks good, create a separate savefile to preserve the original artwork.
*I usually just add "UV" at the end of the filename to make it distinguishable.*

<br>

### 3. Delete all the unnecessary elements including knobs, switches, LEDs, pedal layout, and **background.*
**this depends on the artwork*

*Basta yung need lang iprint ang ititira lol*

<br>

### 4. Vectorize artwork if not yet done. (skip to step 6 if alr vector)
*Do this to all layers. Make sure to select "color" and "ignore white". Adjust parameters according to taste.*

<br>

### 5. Expand each layer. Do this to the text layers as well.
*This will deconstruct everyhing on the layer into smaller shapes/blocks.*

<br>

### 6. Select all layer, then use the divide option in the pathfinder tool.
*This will merge all layers into one layer and will remove any overlaps. Name the resulting layer to "COLOR"*

<br>

### 7. Clean up the entire color layer. 
Object > Path > Clean Up...

*This will prepare the artwork for the next few steps*

<br>

### 8. Duplicate the COLOR layer, then place the duplicate below the original layer
*Dragging the layer onto the "Create New Layer" works best since it doesn't change the alignment.*

### 9. Load Tayda's RolandVersaWorks color swatches.

A. Click the bookshelf icon > other library > Select RolandVersaWorks (located in the Tayda UV Printing folder of the repository)

### 10. Apply RDGW_WHITE on the duplicate layer, then rename layer to "WHITE".

- *The swatch will show up gray-looking, but the UV printer will interpret it as white.*

- *This will serve as backing for dark colored enclosures.*

- *This also contains other options such as gloss and metallic finish.*

- *The file should only contain these 2 layers (unless the artwork needs gloss).*

<br>

### 11. The WHITE layer should be completely hidden beneath the COLOR layer.
*You can check by toggling the COLOR layer on and off.*

### 12. Save as PDF, then you're done! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
